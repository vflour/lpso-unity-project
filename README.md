Welcome to the respository for LPSOR's source code. Yay.
I'm not used to using github (I rarely use it, haha) so if I'm missing anything -- don't hesitate to contact me!

1. Version information

This project currently uses Unity version 2022.1.15f1. For Windows and Linux builds, it uses the latest Visual Studio 2022 build tools build. For MacOS and iOS builds, it uses the latest XCode 14.x.x
For Android builds, it uses the latest JDK 8 and Android SDK 32, the JDK builds can be found here: https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads?field_java_parent_version_target_id=416&field_operating_system_target_id=436&field_architecture_target_id=391&field_java_package_target_id=396

2. Source code

Feel free to download the source code and tinker with the game. Just *please* don't redistribute it for your own selfish purposes, thank you.
If you need me to make any changes at the code, please do tell! I've been learning how to use Unity for around a year (at the time this was written), so I'm still learning. Seriously, if you think something needs improving I would not mind at all ^^; (just please and try to be respectful, ahah.)

3. Contact information

My Discord is Daoko#7657 if you need to talk to me.
